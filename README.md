# FRC2020

The official codebase for FRC 5160, The Chargers ([tba link](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/5160)), for the 2020 FRC season.

Our codebase is written in Python through the use of the [robotpy](robotpy.readthedocs.io/) framework.

Currently all of our code for this season is split across a few folders under `robots/`
- **batholomew-richard-fitzgerald-smythe** is our competition robot
- **kirkland** is last year's robot -- we're currently using it as a testbed for larger systems
- **limelight-testbed** is code for a motor controller/limelight testbed strapped onto a cart
